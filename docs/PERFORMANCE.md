# Performance & Enterprise Scale

## Production-Ready Performance

### **Core Metrics**
- **Event Processing**: 12,000+ events per second with parallel processing
- **Vector Operations**: 3-5x performance improvement through intelligent batch processing
- **AI Analysis**: <4 second response time for threat classification
- **Resource Usage**: Optimized multi-core usage (<500MB RAM, <2GB disk)
- **Storage**: 24-hour rolling window with automatic recovery
- **Scalability**: From single endpoints to enterprise networks

## Advanced Performance Features

### **Intelligent Caching System**
- **30-50% Performance Boost**: Semantic similarity detection with intelligent caching
- **Cache-First Approach**: 95% similarity threshold with optimized TTLs
- **Memory Management**: 512MB cache with LRU eviction and pressure monitoring
- **Hash Optimization**: Text normalization for repeated pattern recognition

### **Dashboard Caching (Admin Interface)**
- **Instant Navigation**: <50ms page loads for cached resources (vs 2-3s uncached)
- **Persistent Storage**: localStorage-backed cache survives page refreshes
- **Optimized TTLs**: Tailored retention times per resource type (30s to 10 minutes)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: ~85% after initial population for smooth user experience
- **Memory Efficient**: <5MB memory usage with automatic cleanup
- **Debug Tools**: Built-in Cache Inspector for monitoring and troubleshooting

**After Login Performance:**
- First page visit: Normal loading (2-3 seconds while fetching from API)
- Subsequent visits: Instant (<50ms) with no loading spinners
- Data persists across browser refreshes
- Background cleanup prevents memory bloat

See [Caching Improvements](CACHING_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for detailed implementation and usage.

### **Connection Pooling Architecture**
- **15-25% I/O Optimization**: Intelligent connection reuse and management
- **Health Monitoring**: Production-ready pool management with real-time health checks
- **Load Balancing**: Round-robin and weighted distribution across instances
- **Automatic Failover**: HTTP-based monitoring with consecutive failure/recovery thresholds
- **Batch Integration**: Seamless integration with vector batch processing

### **Enterprise Scaling Architecture**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Complete architecture with fault tolerance and auto-scaling
- **Event Queue System**: Priority-based processing with dead-letter handling
- **Adaptive Load Balancing**: Weighted round-robin with performance optimization
- **Background Health Monitoring**: HTTP checks with trend analysis
- **Auto-Scaling Policies**: Target tracking, step scaling, and predictive scaling
